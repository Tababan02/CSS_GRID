This project, titled CSS_GRID, showcases the application of CSS Grid across five HTML pages that display structured layouts for different datasets: employees, actors, students, animals, and products. Each page features a grid layout to present relevant information, such as employee IDs and salaries, actor details, student courses, animal classifications, and product specifications. The project is built using HTML and CSS, demonstrating the versatility of CSS Grid for organizing data visually. Users can easily clone the repository, modify the data, and explore the grid layouts by opening the HTML files in a web browser. The repository includes a comprehensive README file detailing the project's structure, technologies used, and instructions for use and contribution.
